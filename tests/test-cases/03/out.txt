Moving along… Oh God, what have I done? Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away! The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well made bed. You will practice until you can make your bed in your sleep.
Is that a cooking show? Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor. Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates… PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon.
Oh God, what have I done? No. We're on the top. Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court! OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can.
Acidentally, you have a dime up your nose. Actually, that's still true. Tell her she looks thin. No! The cat shelter's on to me.

Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you? It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool.
All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong? Saving the world with meals on wheels. It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. Saving the world with meals on wheels.
